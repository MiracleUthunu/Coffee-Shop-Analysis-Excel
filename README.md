# Coffee-Shop-Analysis-Excel
This project equips coffee shop owners with the power of Excel to analyze their business data. 
 By organizing coffee shop data (product details, sales, anonymized customer details) and creating insightful visualizations (charts, graphs) in Excel, owners can gain valuable customer insights (popular drinks, buying habits) and translate them into actionable business decisions (optimized product mix, targeted promotions). This approach leads to a data-driven understanding of customer behavior and sales trends, ultimately improving sales performance, efficiency, and overall coffee shop success.
